Installing and Using Third-Party Modules

To use third-party modules, you first need to install them using npm. Hereâ€™s how:

1. Install a Module
For example, to install the lodash module, run:

npm install lodash

2. Import and Use the Module
After installing, you can use it in your code:

// useLodash.js
const _ = require('lodash');
const log = require('./logger');

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const shuffled = _.shuffle(numbers);

log(shuffled);
In this example, we import lodash using require and use its shuffle function to shuffle an array of numbers.
